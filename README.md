# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets


## 🗣️ Project Overview

In times of crisis, platforms like Twitter often become real-time channels for reporting emergencies. Tweets can provide firsthand updates on floods, fires, earthquakes, and other disasters. However, distinguishing between genuine reports and metaphorical or unrelated uses of similar language remains a challenge — especially for machines.

For instance:

“The city is ablaze with excitement tonight!”
describes an event using the word ablaze, but there’s no real disaster involved.

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to recognize that difference: Is a tweet referring to a real disaster, or not?

## 🎯 Objective

Using a dataset of over 10,000 hand-labeled tweets, the task is to build a model that can classify each tweet as:

1 — if it references an actual disaster

0 — if it does not

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

Automated systems that can interpret and categorize tweets like this are increasingly important for:

Disaster response teams filtering real-time reports

News agencies monitoring unfolding events

Social listening tools analyzing trends and public sentiment

This type of classification can help reduce noise and highlight urgent information that requires action.
